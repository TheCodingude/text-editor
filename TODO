- have more info of the file in fb (size, edit time, etc)
 

Maybe:
- render text as a truetype font instead of bitmap array - i looked into it but nothing i did worked so ill come back to it



DONE:
- dragging files into folder when in fb 
- open folders in file browser
- organize files in file broweser
- number lines
- scroll bar 
- holding control and left/right arrow should move the cursor(and selection) to the next space or \n
- selection up/down
- make typing when selecting replace the selected text
- copy/paste from clipboard
- make backspace when selecting remove all selected text
