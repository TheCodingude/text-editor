- copying, pasting, and cutting files in the file browser


Maybe:
- render text as a truetype font instead of bitmap array - i looked into it but nothing i did worked so ill come back to it



DONE(out of the things i actually put on the list):
- ctrl-r renames file in fb
- Delete deletes file in fb
- Control-n in fb creates a new file
- have more info of the file in fb (size, edit time, etc)
- dragging files into folder when in fb 
- open folders in file browser
- organize files in file browser
- number lines
- scroll bar 
- holding control and left/right arrow should move the cursor(and selection) to the next space or \n
- selection up/down
- make typing when selecting replace the selected text
- copy/paste from clipboard
- make backspace when selecting remove all selected text
