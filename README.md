# Text Editor Project

No idea what i should call it but i wanted to make my own code editor 

i plan for this to have the same features as [my old editor](https://github.com/TheCodingude/Editor) than i made in python plus a lot more

# WARNING

spaghetti code

## Quick start

```
make
./main {file_path} 
```
